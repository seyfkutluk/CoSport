# Onboarding Part II

![](images/0.png)

In part II you are going to learn:

- how to leverage the protocol-delegate pattern when building apps
- how to coordinate view controller display in `AppDelegate`
- how to save app state to disk via `UserDefaults`

All important stuff you can be expected to be asked to applications you work on professionally.

Show video explaining:

- what protocol-delegate pattern is
- how it works
- how we can use it when building applications


## Protocol-Delegate Login

First lets define the protocol and delegate.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
protocol LoginViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
//    func didLogin(_ sender: LoginViewController) //  in you need to pass data back
    func didLogin()
}

weak var delegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate?

if username == "" && password == "" {
    signInButton.configuration?.showsActivityIndicator = true
    delegate?.didLogin()

```

- Discuss alternative naming conventions.

Then let's use it in `AppDelgate` to signal login was complete and successful.

**AppDelegate**

Need to keep our view controllers around so we can register ourselves as the delegate.

```swift
import UIKit

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
        
    let loginViewController = LoginViewController()
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
                
        loginViewController.delegate = self
        
        window?.rootViewController = loginViewController
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        print("foo - Did login")
    }
}
```

- Discuss why `let` vs `var`

- Test it out. 
- Should now see print statement.
- Discuss how to filter print statements.

## Protocol-Delegate Onboarding
 
Boss challenge - not you add it to onboarding.

Open up `OnboardingContainerViewController`. 

Go through same steps we did in login:

- Define protocol named:

```swift
didFinishOnboarding()
```

- Assign as `weak var` variable
- Call delegate when onboarding complete - `Done` button pressed or `Close` (where the `TODOs` are located).
- Then switch to `AppDelegate` - assign yourself as delegate in there.
- Implement the protocol
- Set onboarding as the `rootViewController` temporarily for testing.
- Print out statement when onboarding done.

Good luck!

**OnboardingContainerViewController**

```swift
protocol OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didFinishOnboarding()
}

var pages = [UIViewController]()
weak var delegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate?

@objc func closeTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    delegate?.didFinishOnboarding()
}
    
@objc func doneTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    delegate?.didFinishOnboarding()
}
```

**AppDelegate**

```swift
let onboardingContainerViewController = OnboardingContainerViewController()

onboardingContainerViewController.delegate = self
window?.rootViewController = onboardingContainerViewController

extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        // TODO: Display home screen
        print("foo - Did onboard")
    }
}
```

OK let's test it out. Click `Next` and `Close`. Yay ðŸŽ‰!
  
## Transitioning like a pro

Now that we have our protocol-delegate hooked up, let's us it to only onboard once.

Let's comment back in the `loginViewController` in our `AppDelegate`.

```swift
window?.rootViewController = loginViewController
```

Then let's display onboarding when login completes.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        window?.rootViewController = onboardingContainerViewController
    }
}
```

OK now, this works. But it is a bit abrupt. It directly replaces the login with the onboarding vc on the `rootViewController` but there is no nice transition or animation. Let's fix that.

Add this method into the `AppDelegate`.

```swift
func setRootViewController(_ vc: UIViewController, animated: Bool = true) {
    guard animated, let window = self.window else {
        self.window?.rootViewController = vc
        self.window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return
    }

    window.rootViewController = vc
    window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    UIView.transition(with: window,
                      duration: 0.3,
                      options: .transitionCrossDissolve,
                      animations: nil,
                      completion: nil)
}
```

And replacing setting the rootViewController directly with this.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        setRootViewController(onboardingContainerViewController)
    }
}
```

- Discuss: Explain what is going on here with animation etc.

Great - so we can onboard and transition. But how can we ensure that users can only on board once.

To do that we need a home screen, or at least some place we can send people after they have logged in.

In the next session we'll see how we can 

- setup a dummy view controller to temporaily nagivate to
- give it the ability to logout



## Logging out

Create new class `DummyViewController` in `Login` directory. Go ahead and type this code in.

**DummyViewController**

```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    let stackView = UIStackView()
    let label = UILabel()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        style()
        layout()
    }
}

extension ViewController {
    func style() {
        stackView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        stackView.axis = .vertical
        stackView.spacing = 20
        
        label.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        label.text = "Dummy"
        label.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .title1)
    }
    
    func layout() {
        stackView.addArrangedSubview(label)
        
        view.addSubview(stackView)
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            stackView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
            stackView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor),
        ])
    }
}
```

- Discuss - create a snippet if you haven't already for this. We are going to reuse this going forward. Will save some typing.

Add a login button.

```swift
let logoutButton = UIButton(type: .system)

logoutButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
logoutButton.configuration = .filled()
logoutButton.setTitle("Logout", for: [])
logoutButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(logoutButtonTapped), for: .primaryActionTriggered)

stackView.addArrangedSubview(logoutButton)

@objc func logoutButtonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
    
}
```

Discussion

 - Explain @objc
 - Explain selector
 - Explain method signature of selector

Now lets apply protocol-delegate to it.

Normally we would add protocol-delegate definition to`DummyViewController`, but in this case, because I know we are going to want to reuse this later in our real view controller, lets define it in `LoginViewController`.

Define the protocol in `LoginViewController`.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
protocol LogoutDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didLogout()
}
```

So we can define it there, and then use it in `DummyViewController` like this.

**DummyViewController**

```swift
weak var logoutDelegate: LogoutDelegate?

@objc func logoutButtonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
    logoutDelegate?.didLogout()
}
```

At this point our `DummyViewController` is ready to go. Now we just need to sign up and use it in `AppDelegate`


## Logout Protocol-Delegate


OK so now we are ready to use in `AppDelegate`. React to logout.
**AppDelegate**

```swift
let dummyViewController = DummyViewController()

dummyViewController.logoutDelegate = self

extension AppDelegate: LogoutDelegate {
    func didLogout() {
        setRootViewController(loginViewController)
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        setRootViewController(dummyViewController)
    }
}
```

Test it out. When we hit logout we end up back at the loging screen. But our spinner is still spinning. Fix like this.

**LoginViewController**

```swift
override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
    signInButton.configuration?.showsActivityIndicator = false
}
```

So that that we have this setup, we are in a place where we can actually try to remember whether the user has already been through the onboarding process.

Let's track this in memory.

## Onboarding once in memory

Tracking in memory is he easiest thing we can do, and a good place to start. Let's create a variable representing whether someone has onboarded, and then set it when they have.

**AppDelegate**

```swift
var hasOnboarded = false
    
extension AppDelegate: OnboardingContainerViewControllerDelegate {
    func didFinishOnboarding() {
        hasOnboarded = true
        setRootViewController(dummyViewController)
    }
}
```

And then update our `didLogin` to leverage this logic.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: LoginViewControllerDelegate {
    func didLogin() {
        if hasOnboarded {
            setRootViewController(dummyViewController)
        } else {
            setRootViewController(onboardingContainerViewController)
        }
    }
}
```

If we run this now we'll see that is almost works. We just have a left over spinner that we need to reset. We can do that like this.



Test. Now everything works. Can onboard once, and never again for that session.

Now this is pretty good, but look what happens if we restart the app. It forgets.

Let's make our app permanently remember by storing this state on the phone. Using something called `UserDefaults`.

## Onboarding once on disk

- What are `UserDefaults`?
- What are they good for?
- How do they work?
- Show students all the different types they can save (your page).

Create a dir called `Utils`. Create a new class in there called `LocalState`.

```swift
public class LocalState {
    
    private enum Keys: String {
        case hasOnboarded
    }
    
    public static var hasOnboarded: Bool {
        get {
            return UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: Keys.hasOnboarded.rawValue)
        }
        set(newValue) {
            UserDefaults.standard.set(newValue, forKey: Keys.hasOnboarded.rawValue)
            UserDefaults.standard.synchronize()
        }
    }
}
```

Then instead of storing in a variable, will store on disk.

- Delete variable `onboarded`.
- Replace with `LocalState.hasOnboarded`
- Run and test. It remembers ðŸŽ‰.
- Save your work.
